THIS FOLDER CONTAINS WORK DONE BY BOTH MYSELF AND OTHER MEMBERS OF A GROUP PROJECT

Files created by myself include Gate.java, GateConsole.java and GateInfoDatabase.java and the JUnit Testing Code



This directory contains just the outline Java files from the SAAMS Together project.

These files are auto-generated by Together, and so are missing many basic details that would allow them to be compiled.

The files are suitable for, say, populating the src folder of an Eclipse Java project.
